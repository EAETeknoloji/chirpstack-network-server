EAE Edits

- .goreleaser.yml file is changed and CHANGELOG.md file is created. We only require Linux goos and amd64 goarch. Other os and arch are of no interest to us. This edition is performed to narrow down scope and save time. Tag v3.16.2 is also moved to latest commit to compile files without hassle and prevent dirty state. (26 May 2022)
